JavaScript Text Twist

I wrote this about two years ago when I was
learning jQuery. With that considered, it
actually is not that bad. There are a lot
of improvements that can be made, both structurally
and performance wise.

I have begun a HTML5 Canvas version that
uses websockets as opposed to having the
dictionary load on page. Additionally,
a scoreboard system will be present as well
as mobile friendly controls. 

I will likely continue to poly fill structural
and performance enhancements to this version
so people with older browsers can still
participate in the fun.

Dictionary based on of *nix /usr/share/dict/words
